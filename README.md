The main  purpose of this project basically  is to  analyze and visualize data using Tableau from CitiBike company in New York City which will be presented to a group of investors to c convince and impress them on how lucrative a bike sharing business will be if invested into in a new city. We downloaded a data for the month of August 2019  from the NYC Citibike website. In this visualzation, I was able to compare relationship between different situations which brougth about 5 ploted visualization.

THE LENGHT OF TIME USED BY CUSTOMER.

As Shown in fig 1, the majority of the bike trips duration are between 0 -10mins.In generall all bike trip durations are less than 60 minutes. When categorized by gender dimenasion, its obvious that majority of the users are male, however, all genders have similar trip duration (used time). 

THE MOST OFTEN TIME OF THE DAY FOR BIKE USAGE

In the above figure 2, the bikes are most commonly used during commute times around 7am -9am, though mostly at 8am and 5-6pm on weekdays, and during the afternoon on weekends. moreso, the male uses the most stoptime at 8am on weekdays and between 1pm to 5pm on weekends. The male is more significant when you compare these times by gender. 


In figure 3, Bikes are being used by subscribers  more frequently than customers, and the majority of subscribers use the bikes during the week. Customers use the bikes more frequently on weekends.


WHERE BIKES ARE USED THE MOST 

figure 4, the most popular starting and ending locations are almost identical, and are in the same area of Manhattan. The top 10 starting locations are all in Manhattan, and the top 10 ending locations are all in Manhattan or Brooklyn.


Summary
in essence, bike-sharing usage in New York City is very high and lucrative, easy to analyzes and predict.The most popular times of the day for bike usage are usually during the general busy times for commuters, and the most popular locations should also be predictable and unchanging. This makes it easy to predict where to place more bikes. Also this analyses will help us to decided what previledges or bonuses that can be given to subscribers and customers.  However, there are some limitations to this analysis. sicne the data used is from August 2019. This could affect our conclusion if the usage pattern has changed from the previous used for our analysis. and it is possible that the usage patterns have changed since then. For an accurate analysis and predection, a recent dataset will be of great advantage In order to get a more accurate picture of the usage patterns. Also we can do analyses for other neigbouring cities which will help us analyzes possible future challenges especially when their population is not as much as NYC. Additional visualizations that would be helpful to investors would be the usage of specific bikes and the income and expenditure generated from each bike before they are replaced. Also to analysed the most preferred bike buy users.This would help our inverstors to invest wisely.

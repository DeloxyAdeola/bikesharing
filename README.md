# bikesharing
The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize data from CitiBike in New York City in order to help convince investors that a bike-sharing program in a new city is a solid business proposal. The data used in this project is from August 2019, and is visualized using Tableau.

Seen in figure 1, the majority of trips are less than 10 minutes and the vast majority of trips are less than 1 hour. When divided by gender, the results show that the majority of users are male, and usage time between genders is similar.

What are the most popular times of the day for bike usage?
